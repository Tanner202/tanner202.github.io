      <description>In this blog post I talk about my experience learning to create Minecraft Servers and Plugins.
Backstory As a kid I played a lot of video games. I mainly played Minecraft on online servers like Mineplex and Hypixel. During these days everything was fun and exciting. As I got older these servers started to fade away and things changed. However my love for those exeriences hadn&amp;rsquo;t gone away. This is when I made the decision that I wanted to create my own server.</description>

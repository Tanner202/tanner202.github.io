      <description>Creating a video game takes many skills, especially if you’re doing it solo. In this blog post I will be sharing 5 mistakes that I made when creating a game in the summer of 2023.

      <description>Modifying Existing Games I started game development around 4-5 years ago creating Minecraft plugins. Modifying an existing game is a great way to get started learning game development because most of the tools are already in place.

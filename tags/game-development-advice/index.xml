      <description>Modifying Existing Games I started game development around 4-5 years ago creating Minecraft plugins. Modifying an existing game is a great way to get started learning game development because most of the tools are already in place.
If you enjoy any existing games and would like to build off or modify in any way, I definitely recommend it. Games like Roblox are built as easy to use tools to create games but can also be quite powerful.</description>

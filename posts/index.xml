      <description>✨Hello! In this blog post I&amp;rsquo;m going to be talking about my experience making a game called snow fort defense. ✨
Beginning I started this project at the start of the summer in 2023. This was a project I had the idea for quite some time but hadn&amp;rsquo;t had the time to do because of school. My plan was simple: create a video game during the 10 weeks of summer. In my mind at the time I thought this was plenty of time to create a full game and I was ready.</description>

      <description>In this blog post I talk about my experience learning to create Minecraft Servers and Plugins.
Backstory As a kid I played a lot of video games. I mainly played Minecraft on popular online servers like Mineplex and Hypixel. During these days, I would wake up, hop on a call with my friends, and we would just play games. As I got older, these servers started to fade away and things changed.</description>

      <description>Modifying Existing Games I started game development around 4-5 years ago creating Minecraft plugins. Modifying an existing game is a great way to get started learning game development because most of the tools are already in place.
If you enjoy any existing games and would like to build off or modify in any way, I definitely recommend it. Games like Roblox are built as easy to use tools to create games but can also be quite powerful.</description>
